## 🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Data preparation and cleaning were performed using **Python**:

### Steps Performed
- **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using `pandas`
- **Initial Exploration:**  
  - Used `df.info()` to inspect structure  
  - Used `df.describe()` for summary statistics  

- **Missing Value Handling:**  
  - Identified missing values  
  - Imputed missing `review_rating` values using the **median rating per product category**

- **Column Standardization:**  
  - Renamed all columns to **snake_case** for consistency

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Created `age_group` by binning customer ages  
  - Created `purchase_frequency_days` from purchase frequency data  

- **Data Consistency Check:**  
  - Identified redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used`  
  - Dropped `promo_code_used`

- **Database Integration:**  
  - Connected Python to **PostgreSQL**  
  - Loaded the cleaned dataset into the database for SQL analysis

## 🗄️ Data Analysis Using SQL (PostgreSQL)
SQL queries were used to answer key business questions:

1. **Revenue by Gender** – Compared total revenue between male and female customers  
2. **High-Spending Discount Users** – Customers using discounts but spending above average  
3. **Top 5 Products by Rating** – Products with highest average review ratings  
4. **Shipping Type Comparison** – Average purchase amount: Standard vs Express shipping  
5. **Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers** – Average spend and total revenue comparison  
6. **Discount-Dependent Products** – Top 5 products with highest discounted purchase rate  
7. **Customer Segmentation** – Classified customers as:
   - New  
   - Returning  
   - Loyal  
8. **Top 3 Products per Category** – Most purchased products in each category  
9. **Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions** – Likelihood of subscription for customers with >5 purchases  
10. **Revenue by Age Group** – Revenue contribution across age segments
